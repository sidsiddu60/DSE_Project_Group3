Data Science Final Project information 

SYNOPSIS:

The data taken for our project is one such dataset that belongs to Hospitality Industry, which is a historical data collected from 2015 â€“ 2018. The dataset is collected from a research paper which describes a hotel customer dataset with 31 variables describing a total of instances (customers).

Objectives:

1.	To propose an Unsupervised Machine Learning model that can assist in finding the clusters for the provided data.
2.	To study the clusters and understand the customers behaviors based on their segments 

Description of the Dataset:

This data article describes a hotel customer dataset with 31 variables describing a total of 83,590 instances (customers). It comprehends three full years of customer behavioral data. In addition to personal and behavioral information, the dataset also contains demographic and geographical information.
Due to its unit of analysis, it is a dataset especially suitable for building customer segmentation models, including clustering and RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value) models, but also be used in classification and regression problems


Project Outcome:
Our model helps us to find patterns in the customer booking behavior or preferences using unsupervised machine learning techniques so that it is possible to label customers into 4 to 6 segments. Clustering algorithms can unveil underlying trends and associations hidden from the classic analysis and help create more effective customer segmentation.
